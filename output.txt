Joint authorship of articles, in which different users participate in correcting, editing, and compiling replace_the finished product, can also cause editors to become tenants in common of replace_the copyright, making it impossible to republish without permission of all co-owners, some of whose identities may be unknown due to pseudonymous or anonymous editing.[10] Where persons contribute to a collective work such as an encyclopedia, replace_there is, however, no joint ownership if replace_the contributions are separate and distinguishable.[56] Despite most wikis' tracking of individual contributions, replace_the action of contributing to a wiki page is still arguably one of jointly correcting, editing, or compiling, which would give rise to joint ownership. Some copyright issues can be alleviated through replace_the use of an open content license. Version 2 of replace_the GNU Free Documentation License includes a specific provision for wiki relicensing; Creative Commons licenses are also popular. When no license is specified, an implied license to read and add content to a wiki may be deemed to exist on replace_the grounds of business necessity and replace_the inherent nature of a wiki, although replace_the legal basis for such an implied license may not exist in all circumstances.[citation needed]

Wikis and replace_their users can be held liable for certain activities that occur on replace_the wiki. If a wiki owner displays indifference and forgoes controls (such as banning copyright infringers) that replace_they could have exercised to stop copyright infringement, replace_they may be deemed to have authorized infringement, especially if replace_the wiki is primarily used to infringe copyrights or obtains a direct financial benefit, such as advertising revenue, from infringing activities.[10] In replace_the United States, wikis may benefit from Section 230 of replace_the Communications Decency Act, which protects sites that engage in "Good Samaritan" policing of harmful material, with no requirement on replace_the quality or quantity of such self-policing.[57] It has also been argued, however, that a wiki's enforcement of certain rules, such as anti-bias, verifiability, reliable sourcing, and no-original-research policies, could pose legal risks.[58] When defamation occurs on a wiki, replace_theoretically, all users of replace_the wiki can be held liable, because any of replace_them had replace_the ability to remove or amend replace_the defamatory material from replace_the "publication". It remains to be seen whereplace_ther wikis will be regarded as more akin to an internet service provider, which is generally not held liable due to its lack of control over publications' contents, than a publisher.[10] It has been recommended that trademark owners monitor what information is presented about replace_their trademarks on wikis, since courts may use such content as evidence pertaining to public perceptions. Joshua Jarvis notes, "Once misinformation is identified, replace_the trademark owner can simply edit replace_the entry".[59]
